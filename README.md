Web-programming - JavaScript home assignment
This solution was submitted by the stundent named above for a Web-programming assignment.
Hereby I declare that the solution is my own work. I did not copy or use solutions from a third party. I did not share this solution with fellow students, and I did not publish it. 
According to the Academic Regulations for Students (Eötvös Loránd University Organisational and Operational Regulations – Volume 2, Section 74/C), a student purporting the intellectual property of others as their own [...] is committing a disciplinary offence.
The worst result of a disciplinary offence can be the expulsion of the student.
